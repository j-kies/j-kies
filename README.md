## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Lead HMI developer in Spyrosoft and a person who pays great attention to the quality of thecreated solutions, specializing in the development of Qt-based software with focus on QML applications.

ðŸŒ± In my work, I put my skills of detailed analysis and problem-solving to use. I believe that the core of an IT specialist is not just pure technological knowledge, but a combination of many skills that can be used together to achieve your goals. That is why in my work I deal not only with code but also staff training, requirements analysis, co-creating marketing content and searching for new solutions to existing problems.

ðŸ”­ In my free time I love tinkering with smart-home and learning new things such as topics related toself-hosting .On top of that I enjoy trips on a bicycle, reading criminal novels as well as science-fiction bookstogetherwith playing board and video games.
